# Scenario (hasty-green-berries)

**Summary**: This scenario covers a full two-week Sprint from Sprint Planning to Retrospective. During this Sprint a bug gets fixed, a feature gets implemented, and existing code gets refactored.

**Actors**:

-	Software Engineer(s)
-	Product Owner
-	Scrum Master

**TO DO**: Take the content of the “USE WITH AUTOMATION: bug fix, feature creation, and refactoring” and split it up in which space on the Agility Game board it takes place with which actors. This maps a real-life scenario to a gamified environment. For example, the Sprint Planning activities should be made possible by the Sprint Planning Management microservice, hosted in the Agility Game’s sprint-planning-management repository.
